# Change-Calculator
Spare change calculator built with PHP. This is my first project ever. This app calculates how much spare change you have. It also calculates how much bills and coins (denominations) you need and prints that on the screen. Bills or coins that are not needed are not printed on the screen. It employs a so-called 'greedy algorithm': the minimum amount needed of each denomination is used.The app is inteded to be used in restaurants, stores and so forth.
