# Change-Calculator
Spare change calculator built with PHP. This is my first project ever. This app calculates how much spare change you have. It also calculates how much bills and coins (denominations) you need and prints that on the screen. Bills or coins that are not needed are not printed on the screen. It employs a so-called 'greedy algorithm': the minimum amount needed of each denomination is used.The app is inteded to be used in restaurants, stores and so forth.
 # Getting started
 ## Prerequisites
  You can simply copy the file to your harddrive or server. When copying it to your harddrive you need an local/virtual server enviroment like MAMP or XAMPP. Copy the calculator.php file to your htdocs folder. 
 ## Modifying it
  If you want to use another currency, like for example dollars ($),  you can simply change the ```$denominations``` array and the ```echo``` statements ($ instead of â‚¬).
  
  You can of course modify the UI as you please.
